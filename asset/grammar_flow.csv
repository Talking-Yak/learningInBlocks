We use ’s only with people, animals, or time expressions.

John’s car (a person)

a dog
a book
a car
a teacher

Use “an” before vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, u)

an apple
an egg
an orange
an umbrella
an interesting movie

A university (sounds like you → consonant sound)

3. He wants to buy a car."
13,"Plural Nouns: regular (-s, -es) ","A noun is a word that names a person (teacher, child), place (city, park), animal (dog, cat), or thing (book, chair).
In English, nouns can be singular (only one) or plural (more than one).
Singular means one: a cat, one child, my friend.
Plural means more than one: two cats, many children, our friends.
To make nouns plural, we usually change their form. Most nouns simply add -s, but some require -es or change in special ways. A few words do not change at all. Learning plural nouns is very important because we use them all the time when talking about daily life — our families, things we own, food we eat, or people we meet.

1. Regular Plurals with -s

For most nouns, we simply add -s to make the plural.
book → books
car → cars
dog → dogs
pen → pens
This is the most common way to form plurals in English.

2. Plurals ending with -es

If a noun ends in a sound that is hard to pronounce with just -s, we add -es.
This usually happens when the word ends in: -s, -sh, -ch, -x, -o.

bus → buses
dish → dishes
watch → watches
box → boxes
potato → potatoes

3. Nouns ending in consonant + y

If the noun ends with a consonant + y, we change y → i and add -es.

baby → babies
city → cities

But if the word ends in vowel + y, just add -s.

boy → boys
toy → toys

4. Irregular Plurals

Some words change completely in the plural. These do not follow a rule, so you must remember them.

man → men
woman → women
child → children
person → people
tooth → teeth
foot → feet

mouse → mice","1. I have two books. 
2. There are three buses.
3. The dogs are playing in the park."

41,How much...? / How many...?,"How much” and “How many” are used to ask questions about quantity. These questions help in everyday situations, like shopping, cooking, or talking about time and money.

- “How much” is used with uncountable nouns.
Uncountable nouns are things we cannot count as individual items, such as water, sugar, money, milk, rice, time.

- “How many” is used with countable nouns in the plural form.
Countable nouns are things we can count as separate items, such as books, apples, pens, chairs, friends.

- Structures:
How much + uncountable noun + is/are/there/verb…?
How many + plural countable noun + is/are/there/verb…?","1. How much sugar is in the tea?
2. How many chairs are in the classroom? 
3. How much money do you have?

You can also say “Could I have...?” (more polite) or “May I have...?” (formal).","1. Can I have a glass of water, please?
2. Can I have some bread?
3. Can I have your phone number?"
43,"Giving personal information: name, age, nationality","- Learners should be able to give basic personal information when introducing themselves. This includes telling their name, age, and nationality in short, simple sentences. These are some of the first things we share when meeting new people, making it an essential skill for everyday communication.

- Name: Learners use the verb “to be” or the phrase “My name is”.
Example: I am Rani. / My name is Rani.

- Age: In English, we use the verb “to be” (not have) to talk about age.
Example: I am 20 years old.

- Nationality: To say nationality, learners use “I am + nationality” or “I am from + country”.
Example: I am Indian. / I am from India.

- Learners at this level should practice answering and asking these questions:
What is your name?
How old are you?
Where are you from?

- This skill helps learners introduce themselves politely and confidently in new situations, such as classrooms, meetings, or while traveling.","1. My name is Arjun.
2. I am 18 years old.
3. I am Riya, and I am 20 years old."
44,Describing people and things (simple),"We use simple adjectives and basic structures to talk about what a person or thing looks like, their age, color, size, or other basic qualities.

Structure:

Subject + be (am/is/are) + adjective
Example: She is tall.

We can also use:
Subject + have/has + noun
Example: He has black hair.

Common Adjectives:

For size: big, small, tall, short
For appearance: beautiful, pretty, handsome
For age: young, old
For color: red, blue, black, green","1. She is tall and thin.
2. He is young and handsome.
3. They are short but strong."
45,Forming yes/no questions,"A Yes/No question is a question that can be answered with “Yes” or “No.”

How to Form Them:

The structure depends on the verb:

With verb “to be” (am/is/are):
Am/Is/Are + subject + complement?

With other verbs (Present Simple):
Do/Does + subject + verb?

With Past Simple:
Did + subject + verb?

Start the question with the helping verb (am/is/are, do/does, did).","1. Are you happy? 
2. Is he your brother? 
3. Do you play football? "
46,"Short answers: Yes, I am. / No, he doesn't.","A short answer is a polite and simple way to respond to a Yes/No question without repeating the whole sentence.

How to Form Them:

Use Yes/No + subject pronoun + helping verb (or auxiliary verb).
We do not use the full verb again.

Examples by Tense:

Verb “to be” (Present):

Are you happy? → Yes, I am. / No, I’m not.
Is he a teacher? → Yes, he is. / No, he isn’t.

Present Simple (with do/does):

Do you like pizza? → Yes, I do. / No, I don’t.
Does she play tennis? → Yes, she does. / No, she doesn’t.

Past Simple (with did):

Did they go to school? → Yes, they did. / No, they didn’t.
Key Points:

- Always use the helping verb (am/is/are, do/does, did).
- Never repeat the main verb.
- Use the correct pronoun.","1. Are you tired? → Yes, I am. / No, I’m not.
2. Does he play football? → Yes, he does. / No, he doesn’t.
3. Did they go to the park? → Yes, they did. / No, they didn’t."
47,"Adjective order (basic): a nice, new house","When we use two or more adjectives before a noun, they usually follow a certain order in English. At the A1 level, we focus on opinion and fact adjectives.

Opinion adjectives tell us what we think about something (e.g., nice, beautiful, ugly).

Fact adjectives give factual information like size, age, color (e.g., big, new, red).

Basic order:
Opinion → Fact → Noun
Example: a nice (opinion) new (fact) house (noun)","1. She has a beautiful big garden.
2. I bought an old wooden table.
3. They live in a small red house."
48,because': to give a simple reason," The word because is a conjunction. It is used to connect two ideas: one is the result or action, and the other is the reason for that result or action. In other words, because answers the question “Why?”.

When we use because, we explain why something happened, why someone does something, or why something is true. The clause after because gives the reason.

Main clause (result) + because + reason","1. I stayed home because it was raining.
2. She is happy because she got a new job.
3. We didn’t go out because we were tired."
49,"also', 'too': to add information","Both also and too are words used to add extra information or to say that something is similar to what was said before. They show agreement or addition.

How to use ‘also’:

Also is usually used in the middle of the sentence, before the main verb (except be), or after to be.
It is more formal than too.

How to use ‘too’:

'Too' is usually placed at the end of the sentence.
It is more common in everyday speaking.

Also → goes in the middle of the sentence (before the main verb).
Too → goes at the end of the sentence.","1. I like pizza too.
2. She also likes music.
3. I also play chess.
4. They can speak Spanish too."
50,"Comparative Adjectives (basic): bigger, older, more expensive","Comparative adjectives are used to compare two people, animals, places, or things. They show which one has more of a quality (bigger, older, more expensive).

How to form comparatives:

For short adjectives (one syllable):
Add -er to the adjective.

Big → bigger
Tall → taller

For adjectives ending in -y:
Change y to i and add -er.

Happy → happier

For long adjectives (two or more syllables):
Use more before the adjective.

Expensive → more expensive
Beautiful → more beautiful","1. This house is bigger than that one.
2. My brother is older than me.
3. This bag is more expensive than yours."

90,Questions with prepositions at the end: Who are you talking to?,"Some questions end with a preposition (words like to, with, about, for, at, in). This happens when the question word (who, what, which, where) is asking about the object of the preposition.
- For example:
Statement: You are talking to my friend.
Question: Who are you talking to?
","1. Who are you talking to?
2. What are you looking for?
3. Who are you waiting for?"
91,Indirect Questions: Do you know where the bank is?,"We sometimes ask questions in a polite or indirect way. Instead of asking directly, we add a phrase at the beginning, like Do you know…?, Can you tell me…?, or Could you show me…?
- Indirect questions are useful in everyday situations. They sound more polite and are common when speaking to strangers, teachers, or in formal situations.
","1. Do you know where the bus stop is?
2. Can you tell me how I can get to the station?
3. Could you explain what this word means?"
92,"Conjunctions: although, so, because","Conjunctions are words we use to connect ideas in a sentence.They help us explain reasons, results, or contrast.

93,Word order of adverbs of frequency,"Adverbs of frequency tell us how often something happens.
- Position in a sentence: Adverbs of frequency usually come before the main verb.
Example: She always drinks tea in the morning.
- But if the verb is to be (am, is, are), the adverb comes after the verb.
Example: He is usually on time.

- With auxiliary verbs: When there is an auxiliary verb (have, will, can, etc.), the adverb comes after the auxiliary and before the main verb.
Example: You can always ask me for help.

- Beginning or end of a sentence: Sometimes adverbs of frequency can also come at the beginning or the end of a sentence, but this is less common. It is used for emphasis.

96,"Making suggestions: Let's..., Why don't we...?","When we want to suggest an idea or plan something with other people, we can use special phrases in English. 
-  Let’s + verb: We use Let’s when we want to include ourselves and the other person in the plan.It is short for Let us.  After Let’s, we use the base form of the verb (without to).

Example: Let’s go to the park.

- Why don’t we + verb: We use Why don’t we …? when we suggest something in the form of a question.It is a friendly way to give an idea and ask for agreement.The verb after Why don’t we is also in the base form.

2. A pen is for writing.
3. This box is for keeping old letters."
99,"Possessive Pronouns: mine, yours, his, hers","Possessive pronouns are words we use to show that something belongs to someone. Instead of repeating the noun again, we use a pronoun.

2. That jacket is his, but the shoes are hers.

3.  The shop is closed on Sunday."
102,Articles: 'the' vs. no article (general vs. specific),"We sometimes use the article “the”, and sometimes we use no article (nothing before the noun). This depends on whether we are speaking about something specific or something general.

Example: The book on the table is mine. (a specific book)
Example: I saw the movie you recommended. (a specific movie)

3. He wishes it didn’t rain so much in his town."
122,"Modals of deduction (present): must be, might be, can't be","When we don’t know something for sure, we often make guesses or deductions.

Depending on the tense, “to be” changes form.","1. The new bridge is being built near the city.

128,Reported Speech (questions and commands),"- Reported speech is used to tell someone what another person said, without repeating their exact words. Instead of using quotation marks, we change the sentence so it fits into our own speech.

-  When we report questions, we usually:
Change the word order to a normal statement (subject + verb).Use verbs like asked, wanted to know, wondered.

-  Do not use the auxiliary do/does/did.
Keep the question word (what, where, when, why, how), or use if/whether for yes/no questions.

Example:
Direct question: “Where do you live?”
Reported: He asked me where I lived.

-  When we report commands or requests, we usually:
Use verbs like told, asked, ordered, advised, invited.Use the infinitive (to + verb) instead of the imperative.

148,"Preposition + -ing: good at learning, tired of waiting","After a preposition (words like at, of, in, on, about, for, without), we usually use the -ing form of the verb.
This is because a verb cannot directly follow a preposition in its base form (wait, learn). Instead, we change the verb into the -ing form (waiting, learning).
- Adjective + preposition + -ing
good at doing
- Noun/phrase + preposition + -ing
a way of improving
- Preposition + -ing after certain verbs
They talked about going on holiday.","1. She is good at learning new songs quickly.

- Some phrasal verbs are separable. This means the object can go between the verb and the particle, or after the particle.
Example: turn off the TV = turn the TV off

Example: look after the baby (not look the baby after).","1.She looked up the word in the dictionary.

153,It is said that... / He is said to be...',"We sometimes use “It is said that…” or “He/She is said to…” when we want to talk about what people believe, what people say, or what is generally thought. We use these phrases when we do not know exactly who is saying it, or when we don’t want to say the source of the information.
- Structure:: It is said that + clause
Used when we want to give information in a full sentence.
Example: “It is said that the temple is 500 years old.”

- -ing clauses
We use an -ing clause to describe the person or thing doing an action.
- -ed clauses
We use an -ed clause to describe the person or thing that the action happened to.
- They make sentences shorter and more natural in English. Instead of two sentences, we can join them into one.
Longer: There is a woman. She is talking to Tom.
Shorter: There is a woman talking to Tom.","1. The man standing at the bus stop is my uncle.
2. Do you know the girl wearing the red dress?
3. We saw some children playing in the park."

'an' is used before words that begin with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u) or a silent h (e.g., an apple, an hour).

- When we talk about more than one, but not a specific number, we often use some with plural countable nouns. some means “a number of” or “a few.” It is used when the exact number is not important. For example: some books, some apples.

- We also use some in offers and requests:
Would you like some tea?
Can I have some pencils, please?","1. I need a new notebook for my English class.
2. She is eating an apple while waiting for the bus.
3. There are some chairs in the corner of the room."

174,"""Mustn't"" ""needn't""- Modals","Definition
Mustn’t = It is not allowed. Something is forbidden.
Needn’t = It is not necessary. You don’t have to do it.
Structure
Subject + mustn’t + base verb
Subject + needn’t + base verb","1. Students mustn’t cheat in the exam. 
2. You needn’t bring any food.
3. She needn’t come early tomorrow."
175,Mixed Conditionals: combining second and third conditionals,"- Mixed conditionals are used when we want to connect different times in one conditional sentence. They combine parts of the second conditional (present or future unreal situations) and the third conditional (past unreal situations).

-  The second conditional: If + past simple, would + base verb → talks about unreal or hypothetical situations in the present or future.
Example: If I had more time, I would travel.

-  The third conditional: If + past perfect, would have + past participle → talks about unreal or hypothetical situations in the past.
Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.

- When we mix them, the time in the “if-clause” and the time in the result clause are different. This lets us express how a past event affects the present, or how a present state could have changed the past.","1.  If I spoke French, I would have joined the Paris trip last year.
2. If we had met earlier, we would be good friends today.
3. If they had saved more money, they would be traveling the world now."
176,"Alternatives to 'if' in conditionals: unless, provided that, as long as","While if is the most common way to introduce conditions, at this level it is important to use it with other expressions such as unless, provided that, and as long as. These add variety and precision to your sentences.They are especially common in spoken English, formal agreements, and when expressing rules or requirements.
- Unless:means if not. It introduces a condition that must be avoided or prevented.It is often used to warn or explain a negative result.
Example: You won’t pass the exam unless you study hard. (= You will pass the exam only if you study hard.)

- Provided that: means only if. It sets a strong condition that must be met for something to happen.It is slightly more formal than if.
Example: You can borrow my car provided that you drive carefully. (= You can borrow it, but only on this condition.)

- As long as: also means only if, but it is less formal than provided that.It often suggests a continuing condition or requirement.
Example: I’ll support your decision as long as you explain it clearly.
","1. You won’t understand the film unless you read the book first.
2. The bank will give you the loan provided that you can show proof of income.
3. We can stay out late as long as we return home together."
177,wish' / 'if only' + Past Perfect: for past regrets,"We use wish or if only with the past perfect tense to talk about regrets—things that happened in the past but we would like to change.
- Wish + past perfect expresses that we are unhappy about a past situation or decision.
- If only + past perfect is a stronger way of expressing the same idea. It emphasizes the feeling of regret or disappointment.

- Structure: wish + subject + had + past participle; if only + subject + had + past participle

Examples of meaning
I wish I had studied harder for the exam: I regret not studying enough.
If only we had left earlier, we wouldn’t have missed the train: We regret leaving late.

- These structures do not describe the present or future. They are only used to talk about things that are finished and cannot be changed.","1. I wish I had listened to my teacher’s advice.
2. If only they had called me earlier, I could have helped.
3. I wish we had taken more photos on our trip."
178,wish' + 'would': for complaints,"We often use the structure wish + would to talk about things they find annoying, frustrating, or unpleasant. It is a way of complaining politely or expressing irritation about someone else’s actions or situations we cannot control.

- Structure: Subject + wish + subject + would + verb
Example: I wish you would stop making so much noise.","1. I wish you would stop interrupting me when I’m speaking.
2. She wishes her brother would clean up after himself.
3. I wish the traffic would move faster this morning."
179,Past Perfect Continuous: I had been waiting.,"The Past Perfect Continuous tense is used to show that an action was ongoing for a period of time in the past, and it happened before another past event or before a specific point in the past. It combines the sense of duration (how long something continued) with the idea of sequence (one event before another).

- Structure:Subject + had been + present participle (-ing form of the verb)
Example: I had been waiting for an hour before the train finally arrived.","1. I had been waiting at the bus stop for 30 minutes before the bus finally came.
2. She was exhausted because she had been running all morning.
3. We had been walking in the rain, so our clothes were completely wet."
180,"Future in the Past: I was going to..., I was about to...","The structure future in the past is used to talk about plans, intentions, or actions that someone expected to happen in the future, but from the perspective of the past. It often describes something that was planned but did not actually happen.

- I was going to... : We use I was going to + base verb to talk about something we intended to do in the past, but usually it didn’t happen.It highlights plans, arrangements, or expectations that were later changed.
This structure often introduces contrast between expectation and reality.
Example meaning:
“I was going to study abroad” = I had the plan to study abroad, but in the end, I didn’t.","1. I was going to buy tickets for the movie, but they sold out quickly.
2. We were going to travel last summer, but I changed my plans. 
3. He was going to surprise his parents, but they found out in advance."
181,"Modals of deduction (past): must have done, might have done, can't have done","Modals of deduction are used when we make guesses or draw conclusions about something that happened in the past. They don’t describe facts directly but show how certain or uncertain we are about our ideas.
- Must have + past participle: We use must have done when we are very sure something happened in the past. It is a logical conclusion based on the evidence we have.

Example: “The ground is wet. It must have rained last night.”
(We are almost certain it rained, even though we didn’t see it.)

- Might have + past participle: We use might have done when we are not sure, but it is possible that something happened in the past.

Example: “She is late. She might have missed the bus.”
(It’s possible, but we don’t know for sure.)

- Can’t have + past participle: We use can’t have done when we are sure something did not happen in the past.

Example: “He was in London yesterday. He can’t have attended the meeting in Delhi.”
(It is impossible that he attended.)","1. The train is delayed again; it must have been stuck near a signal.
2. The shop is closed today; they might have taken a holiday for the festival.
3. He was in Chennai the whole week, so he can’t have attended the conference in Delhi."
182,"Passive of reporting verbs: It is believed that..., He is thought to have...","Reporting verbs like say, believe, think, know, expect, report, and consider can be used in the passive voice to introduce information in a more formal or impersonal way. This structure is common in newspapers, academic writing, and formal reports, where the focus is on the information itself rather than the person who believes or says it.
- Structure: It + passive verb + that-clause: It is said that... / It is believed that...
This form emphasizes the idea without mentioning who thinks or believes it.

Example: It is believed that the new law will reduce pollution.

- Structuree: Subject + passive verb + to-infinitive: He is said to... / They are believed to have...

This form allows the subject of the report (e.g., he, they, the company) to appear at the start of the sentence.

Example: The actor is thought to have bought a house in London.
","1. It is said that the company will launch a new product next month.
2. It is expected that the students will pass the exam with good results.
3. She is thought to be one of the best singers of her generation."
183,Complex verb patterns with gerunds and infinitives: regret to inform / regret telling,"- Learners start to see how the meaning of a verb can change depending on whether it is followed by a gerund (-ing form) or an infinitive (to + verb). One common example is the verb regret.

- Regret + to-infinitive: When we use regret + to + infinitive, it is often used in formal English, especially in letters or official communication. It introduces bad news politely. The action expressed by the infinitive usually happens after the moment of speaking.

Example: We regret to inform you that your application was not successful.
Here, the speaker is about to give bad news.

- Regret + gerund (-ing form): When we use regret + -ing, the speaker looks back at something that happened in the past and feels sorry about it. The action expressed by the gerund happened before the regret.

Example: I regret telling her the secret.
Here, the speaker remembers a past action and feels sorry about it.","1. He regretted not studying harder when he saw the exam results.
2. The principal regrets to say that the school trip will not take place this year.
3. The college regrets to announce that the cultural fest will be postponed."
184,"Participle Clauses: Feeling tired, I went to bed early.","- Participle clauses are a way to join ideas in a sentence more smoothly and avoid repetition. They use the present participle (verb + -ing) or the past participle (usually the third form of the verb). Instead of using full clauses with words like because, after, while, although, or when, we can use a participle clause to make the sentence shorter and more natural.

For example:
Because I was feeling tired, I went to bed early.
can be shortened to:
Feeling tired, I went to bed early.

- Types of participle clauses
- Present participle clauses (verb + -ing):Show an action happening at the same time.
Walking through the park, she saw many children playing.
(This means: While she was walking through the park, she saw many children playing.)

- Past participle clauses (third form of the verb):Often show passive meaning or a completed action.
Built in the 18th century, the house is now a museum.
(This means: The house, which was built in the 18th century, is now a museum.)

- Perfect participle clauses (having + past participle):
Show that one action happened before another.
Having finished his work, he left the office.
(This means: After he had finished his work, he left the office.)","1. Feeling nervous, she waited for her interview to start.
2. Built of stone, the castle has survived for hundreds of years.
3. Having read the book twice, he understood the story better."
185,Inversion with negative adverbials: Never have I seen...,"- Inversion means changing the usual word order of a sentence. Normally, a sentence follows the structure: Subject + Verb. For example: I have never seen such a beautiful sunset.

- However, in more formal English, we can place a negative or restrictive adverbial (such as never, rarely, seldom, hardly, not only, at no time, under no circumstances) at the beginning of the sentence. When we do this, we must invert the subject and the auxiliary verb.

- This structure is used to emphasize the idea and make the sentence more dramatic or formal. It is common in written English, speeches, and storytelling, but less common in everyday spoken English.

- How it works:
Start the sentence with a negative or restrictive adverbial.
Invert the subject and the auxiliary/modal verb.

- Normal word order
I had never heard such music before.

- Inversion:
Never had I heard such music before.

Notice how the auxiliary (had) comes before the subject (I).","1. Never have I seen such a powerful performance.
2. Rarely do we get the chance to experience something so unique.
3. No sooner had she arrived than the meeting began."
186,"Cleft Sentences for emphasis: What I need is..., It was John who...","- We often use cleft sentences to give special emphasis to one part of a sentence. A cleft sentence “divides” a normal sentence into two parts, making the important information stand out.

For example:
Normal sentence: John bought the cake.
Cleft sentence: It was John who bought the cake.

Here, the focus is on John.

- Cleft sentences are useful when:
We want to highlight a particular word or phrase.
We want to contrast information (e.g., not Mary, but John).

We want to make our speaking or writing more dramatic or formal.

- Common structures:
It-cleft sentences (most common):
Structure: It + be + focused element + (that/who) + clause
Example: It was yesterday that I met her.

This highlights yesterday instead of just saying I met her yesterday.

- What-cleft sentences:
Structure: What + clause + be + focused element
Example: What I need is a good rest.

Here, the focus is on a good rest.","1. It was my sister who helped me with the project.
2. What surprised me most was her quick decision.
3.  It was at the railway station that we first met."
187,Ellipsis and substitution: leaving out words to avoid repetition,"- We often avoid repeating the same words by using ellipsis or substitution. These two techniques make speech and writing more natural, concise, and fluent.

- Ellipsis means leaving out words when the meaning is still clear from the context. For example, if two sentences share the same verb or phrase, we don’t need to repeat it.
Example: She likes tennis, and he [likes tennis] too. → She likes tennis, and he does too.

- Substitution means replacing a word or phrase with a shorter word (like do, so, one, ones, not) to avoid repeating the original expression.
Example: I need a pen. Do you have one? (Here, one substitutes a pen).

These techniques are very common in spoken English, but they are also used in writing to keep sentences smooth and avoid sounding awkward or repetitive.

- When do we use ellipsis and substitution?
To avoid repeating the same verb, object, or phrase.
To make conversations more natural.
To connect ideas without writing unnecessarily long sentences.","1. I haven’t finished my project yet, but she has [finished her project]. → Ellipsis.
2. I bought the red shoes, but I prefer the blue ones. → Substitution (ones = shoes).
3. Will you come to the meeting? — I think so. → Substitution (so = I will come)."
188,Relative clauses with prepositions: the man with whom I was speaking,"Relative clauses are used to give extra information about a noun. At the B2 level, learners are expected to use relative clauses with prepositions correctly. This structure is more formal and often used in written English.

A relative clause with a preposition connects the clause to a noun using a prepositional phrase (e.g., to whom, with which, about whom). It is formed with a relative pronoun (whom, which, whose) after the preposition. 
For example: The man with whom I was speaking is my teacher.","1. The woman to whom you gave the book is my aunt.
2. This is the hotel in which we stayed during our trip to Goa.
3. The man with whom she went to the theatre is her cousin."
189,Advanced phrasal verbs and their nuances,"- Many phrasal verbs have multiple meanings. For example, take off can mean “an airplane leaving the ground,” but it can also mean “become successful quickly” or “remove clothing.” Knowing the nuance helps you choose the right meaning in conversation or writing.

- Phrasal verbs can also sound more natural and less formal than single-word verbs. For instance, instead of saying encounter, people often say run into. Recognizing this difference allows you to adapt your language depending on whether you are speaking casually, writing formally, or telling a story","1. The new restaurant really took off after a famous food blogger wrote about it.
2. She finally got over her fear of driving on the highway.
3. When I ran into my old teacher at the mall, we had a long chat."
190,"Discourse Markers and linking words: furthermore, consequently, nevertheless","- Learners are expected to use discourse markers and linking words to organize their ideas more clearly and connect sentences smoothly. These words help in writing and speaking by showing the relationship between ideas. They make communication sound more natural and structured.

- Furthermore is used to add extra information or to strengthen an argument. It is similar to ""in addition"" or ""moreover.""
Example: The city has built new parks. Furthermore, it has improved public transport to reduce traffic.

- Consequently shows the result of something. It connects a cause to its effect. It is similar to ""as a result"" or ""therefore.""
Example: He did not study for the exam. Consequently, he failed the test.

- Nevertheless is used to contrast ideas. It introduces information that seems surprising when compared with the previous sentence. It is similar to ""however"" or ""nonetheless.""
Example: It was raining heavily. Nevertheless, the players continued the match.","1. The project was completed on time. Furthermore, the team managed to stay under budget.

2. She forgot to set her alarm. Consequently, she was late for work.

3. The new policy is strict. Nevertheless, most employees support it."
191,Subjunctive mood: I suggest that he be...,"The subjunctive mood in English is used to express things that are not facts but rather wishes, suggestions, demands, or hypothetical situations.One common use is after verbs such as suggest, recommend, insist, demand, propose, advise, request, ask.
- Structure: I suggest that + subject + base form of the verb
Notice that the verb does not change according to subject or tense. 
For example, we say:I suggest that he be more careful (not he is or he should be).","1. The teacher suggested that every student submit the assignment on time.
2. I recommend that she take extra classes before the exam.
3. The manager insisted that the report be completed by Friday."
192,Unreal uses of past tenses: It's time you went...,"We use past tenses not to talk about the past, but to describe unreal or hypothetical situations. One common structure is with the phrase “It’s time…”

- Structure: It’s time + subject + past tense verb
Meaning: We use this structure to express that something should happen now or very soon, even though the verb is in the past tense. The past tense here does not indicate past time. Instead, it makes the statement more polite or less direct. 
For example, when we say “It’s time you went to bed”, we are not talking about the past. We are politely or firmly saying that the person should go to bed now.","1. It’s time you went home; it’s getting dark outside.
2. Don’t you think it’s about time we started preparing for the exams?
3. I think it’s time you learned how to cook for yourself."
193,"Nouns in apposition: John, my brother, is a doctor.","- Nouns in apposition are two nouns or noun phrases placed next to each other, where the second one gives more information about the first. They usually refer to the same person or thing. The second noun explains, identifies, or describes the first more clearly.

For example:
John, my brother, is a doctor.
Here, John and my brother are the same person. The phrase my brother adds extra information to identify John.","1. Ramesh, the captain of our cricket team, encouraged everyone before the match.
2. My cousin Anjali, a talented singer, performed at the festival.
3. The Taj Mahal, a symbol of love, attracts millions of tourists every year."
194,Possessive 's' with time expressions: a two hours' walk,"- The possessive 's is not only used for showing ownership (e.g., John’s car) but also with time expressions to show that something lasts for a certain period of time or is associated with a particular time.

- When we talk about how long an activity takes, or when something belongs to a specific moment, we often use possessive 's after a plural or singular time word.

- Structure:Number + time word + ’s + noun","1. It was a two hours’ walk to the nearest village.
2. She took a year’s break from work to travel abroad.
3. The project faced three days’ delay because of the storm."
195,"Reciprocal pronouns: each other, one another","- Reciprocal pronouns are used when two or more people or things do the same action to one another. They show a two-way (mutual) relationship. In English, the two main reciprocal pronouns are each other and one another.

- Usage
Each other is most commonly used when referring to two people.
Example: John and Mary love each other.

- One another is often used when referring to more than two people, although in modern English both forms can usually be used interchangeably.
Example: The students helped one another during the project.

- Reciprocal pronouns can act as objects in a sentence, receiving the action.
They greeted each other warmly.","1. The two friends supported each other during difficult times.
2. The three colleagues congratulated one another after finishing the project.
3. The children were playing and chasing each other in the park."
196,Generic pronouns: for common gender,"- Generic pronouns are pronouns we use when we want to talk about people in general, without specifying their gender or identity. Learners should understand that there are gender-neutral ways to talk about people:

- They (singular they):
This is now the most common way to refer to a single person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant.
Example: “If anyone calls, tell them I’ll call back later.”

- You (generic you):
This is used to talk about people in general, not the person you are speaking to.
Example: “In life, you have to work hard to succeed.”

- One (formal):
This is used in more formal or academic English, but it is less common in everyday conversation.
Example: “One should always try to keep an open mind.”

- We (inclusive generic):
Sometimes we is used to mean “people in general,” not just the speaker and listener.
Example: “We never know what the future holds.”","1. If anyone forgets their homework, they can bring it tomorrow.
2. You never know how much you can achieve until you try.
3. One should always treat others with respect."
197,Prepositional phrases with complex nouns,"- A prepositional phrase is a group of words that begins with a preposition (such as in, on, at, of, with, for, by, about) and ends with a noun or pronoun. Learners often use prepositional phrases to expand complex nouns, adding detail, clarity, or precision.

- A complex noun is not just a single noun but a noun with modifiers, such as adjectives, other nouns, or additional phrases. When a prepositional phrase follows a complex noun, it gives extra information about the noun. This makes writing and speaking more academic, descriptive, and formal.","1. She gave a presentation on the impact of social media on teenagers.
2. The discovery of ancient tools in the cave surprised the archaeologists.
3. We discussed the challenges of implementing new technology in rural schools"
198,"Adverbial phrases of time, place, and manner","Adverbial phrases are groups of words that act like adverbs. They give more information about the verb in a sentence, usually describing when, where, or how something happens. Unlike single-word adverbs (e.g., quickly, yesterday), adverbial phrases are made up of two or more words.
- Adverbial Phrases of Time: tell us when an action takes place. They can show exact times, durations, or frequency.They usually go at the beginning or end of the sentence.
Examples: in the morning, at the weekend, for many years, from time to time.

- Adverbial Phrases of Place: tell us where something happens. They can describe direction, distance, or position.They usually come after the verb or the object.
Examples: in the corner of the room, at the bus stop, on the top of the hill, in the middle of nowhere.

- Adverbial Phrases of Manner
These phrases describe how something happens or in what way it is done. They often begin with prepositions like with or in.They usually follow the verb.
Examples: with great care, in a hurry, with enthusiasm, in silence.

- Word Order
When a sentence contains adverbial phrases of time, place, and manner together, English often prefers the order: Manner → Place → Time
Example: She worked hard in the office last night.","1. He finished the project with great dedication. 
2. We will meet at the café near the station.
3. She called me in the middle of the night. 
4. The children played quietly in the park all afternoon."
199,Compound adjectives: a ten-year-old boy,- A compound adjective is an adjective made up of two or more words joined together to describe a noun. These words are often connected with a hyphen (-) to show that they function as a single idea.,"1. The team celebrated a record-breaking victory last night.
2. He gave me a well-written essay to review.
3. We went on a five-day trip to the mountains."
200,"Gradable adjectives with adverbs: completely exhausted, very tired","Adjectives describe the quality of a noun, but not all adjectives work in the same way. At B2 level, it is important to understand the difference between gradable adjectives and non-gradable adjectives, and how to use adverbs correctly with them.

- Gradable adjectives: describe qualities that can vary in degree or intensity. For example: tired, cold, happy, big.
You can be a little tired, quite tired, or very tired.
These adjectives can be made weaker or stronger with adverbs such as very, quite, rather, a bit, extremely.

- Non-gradable adjectives: describe absolute qualities. For example: exhausted, freezing, delighted, tiny.
You cannot normally be “very exhausted,” because exhausted already means completely tired. Instead, you use adverbs like completely, absolutely, totally, utterly, really to emphasize them.","1. I was really surprised by the news.
2. The homework was quite difficult yesterday.
3. She felt extremely proud of her achievement."
201,"Non-gradable adjectives with adverbs: completely exhausted, very tired","Adjectives describe the quality of a noun, but not all adjectives work in the same way. At B2 level, it is important to understand the difference between gradable adjectives and non-gradable adjectives, and how to use adverbs correctly with them.

- Gradable adjectives: describe qualities that can vary in degree or intensity. For example: tired, cold, happy, big.
You can be a little tired, quite tired, or very tired.
These adjectives can be made weaker or stronger with adverbs such as very, quite, rather, a bit, extremely.

- Non-gradable adjectives: describe absolute qualities. For example: exhausted, freezing, delighted, tiny.
You cannot normally be “very exhausted,” because exhausted already means completely tired. Instead, you use adverbs like completely, absolutely, totally, utterly, really to emphasize them.","1. After running the marathon, she was completely exhausted and could barely stand.
2. He felt absolutely furious when he found out someone had scratched his car.
3. The children were totally amazed by the magician’s performance."
202,would' for past habits (vs. 'used to'),"When we want to talk about repeated actions or habits in the past, we can use would or used to. Both are common in English, but they are not always interchangeable.

- Would for repeated past actions
We use would + base verb to describe things we did regularly in the past.It focuses on habits, routines, or repeated behaviors, not on states.

Example: When I was a child, we would visit my grandparents every summer.

- Used to for past habits and states
We use used to + base verb to describe both habits and states that were true in the past but are not true now. It works for repeated actions and situations/conditions.

Example: I used to live in Chennai, but now I live in Bangalore. (a past state) ","1. When we were children, we would play cricket in the street until it was dark.
2. Every morning during the summer holidays, my grandfather would tell us stories after breakfast.
3. In college, my friends and I would go to the canteen almost every day after class."
203,Relative clauses with 'what',"- Relative clauses usually begin with relative pronouns like who, which, or that, and they refer back to a noun mentioned earlier. However, what works differently.

- When we use what to introduce a relative clause, it means “the thing(s) that”. Unlike who or which, what does not need an antecedent (a noun before it). Instead, it introduces both the idea of “the thing” and describes it at the same time.
For example: I like what you said. → what you said = the thing that you said","1. What I admire most about her is her patience.
2. He finally achieved what he had been working for.
3. I don’t understand what went wrong during the meeting."
204,Passive verbs with two objects: I was given a book.,"Some verbs can take two objects: a direct object (the thing) and an indirect object (the person who receives it). For example, in the active voice: My friend gave me a book.

me = indirect object (the receiver)
a book = direct object (the thing)

- When we change this kind of sentence into the passive voice, we have two possible passive forms. This is because either object can become the subject of the passive sentence:

- Focus on the indirect object (the receiver):
I was given a book.
Here, the person (“I”) is the subject.

- Focus on the direct object (the thing):
A book was given to me.
Here, the thing (“a book”) is the subject.

Both sentences are correct, but the focus changes. The first version is more common in spoken English because it emphasizes the person receiving something. The second version is often used when the object itself is important.","1. I was sent an invitation to the wedding.
2. An award was given to her for her excellent performance.
3. We were promised more support from the government."
205,Verbs of the senses: see someone do vs. see someone doing,"We often use verbs of the senses—such as see, hear, notice, feel, watch, listen to—to describe experiences. These verbs can be followed by either:
Bare infinitive (do)
-ing form (doing)

- See someone do (bare infinitive)
Structure: see + object + base verb
Meaning: We saw or experienced the complete action, from beginning to end.It often focuses on the whole fact of the action, not the process.

Example: I saw him cross the street. (I saw the whole action—he started on one side and finished on the other.)

- See someone doing (-ing form)
Structure: see + object + verb-ing
Meaning: We saw the action in progress. It often emphasizes the process or part of the action, not necessarily the beginning or end.

Example: I saw him crossing the street. (I noticed him in the middle of the action, walking across.)","1. I saw her close the window before leaving.
2. We saw the children playing cricket in the park.
3. He heard the teacher call his name during the exam."
206,get' in passive constructions: the window got broken,"- We usually form the passive voice with be + past participle, for example:
The window was broken yesterday.

- However, in informal spoken English, we often use get instead of be in passive sentences. This is called the get-passive.

- Structure: Subject + get + past participle
The window got broken.

- Unexpected or accidental events
The get-passive is often used when something happens suddenly, by accident, or without planning.
My phone got lost at the party.

- Focus on the subject, not the doer
Just like with the be-passive, the focus is on what happened to the subject, not who did it.
The shop got robbed last night. (We don’t say who robbed it.)","1. The window got broken during the football game.
2. She got promoted after two years of hard work.
3. His wallet got stolen while he was on the bus."
207,"Modifying comparatives: significantly better, slightly more expensive","A modifier is a word or phrase that gives more information about another word. When we use modifiers with comparatives, we can show whether the difference is large or small.

- Large difference: significantly, much, far, considerably, a lot
Example: This laptop is significantly faster than my old one.
(The difference in speed is big.)

- Small difference: slightly, a little, a bit, marginally
Example: This phone is slightly more expensive than that one.
(The difference in price is small.)

- We place the modifier before the comparative form:much better, far more exciting, slightly less difficult

- This structure allows speakers to be more precise and accurate in communication. For example, instead of just saying “This book is better”, you can say “This book is much better” or “This book is slightly better”, depending on the situation.","1. This hotel is much cheaper than the one we stayed in last summer.
2. Her English has improved significantly more since she started practicing every day.
3. The train is slightly faster than the bus, but also more expensive."
208,Determiners: 'whole' ,"Both whole and all are determiners that refer to the complete amount of something, but they are used differently in English grammar. 
- Whole: means entire or complete.It is normally used with singular countable nouns.

- Structure: the/my/this + whole + singular noun

- All: also means the complete amount but is more flexible than “whole.”
It can be used with plural countable nouns or uncountable nouns, as well as with some singular nouns.

-Structure: all + plural/uncountable noun
all (of) + determiner/pronoun + noun","1. I read the whole book in one day.
2. She ate the whole cake by herself.
3. We spent the whole morning cleaning the house."
209,Advanced use of articles: philosophical/abstract use,"- Learners begin to notice that articles (a, an, the, or zero article) are not only used for concrete things (like a book, the table) but also for abstract or philosophical ideas. This use can sometimes be confusing, because the same noun may take the, a/an, or no article depending on the meaning or focus.

- Using “the” for universal concepts: When we want to talk about an idea in a general, universal, or unique way, we often use the.
Example: the truth, the meaning of life, the future.
Here, “the” suggests there is one main, shared idea.

- Using “a/an” for one example of an idea
When we want to show one version, perspective, or interpretation of an abstract concept, we use a/an.
Example: a truth, a hope, a beauty.
This suggests it is not the only one, but one among many.

- Zero article (no article) for general concepts
When speaking about ideas in general, without pointing to any particular version, we use no article.
Example: Truth is important, Life is short, Beauty fades.
Here, we mean the concept in its most general sense.

- Philosophical effect of article choice
The choice of article can slightly change the meaning.
Truth is important (general concept).
The truth is important (one specific truth, or truth as a shared idea).
A truth is important (one example of truth, among others).","1. The truth about his actions finally came out in the meeting.
2. A truth that many people forget is that happiness often comes from simple things.
3. Truth is sometimes more difficult to accept than lies."
210,Determiners: 'all',"Both whole and all are determiners that refer to the complete amount of something, but they are used differently in English grammar. 
- Whole: means entire or complete.It is normally used with singular countable nouns.

- Structure: the/my/this + whole + singular noun

- All: also means the complete amount but is more flexible than “whole.”
It can be used with plural countable nouns or uncountable nouns, as well as with some singular nouns.

-Structure: all + plural/uncountable noun
all (of) + determiner/pronoun + noun","1. All students in the class must submit their assignments by Friday.
2. She spent all her savings on starting her own business.
3. All of the evidence suggests that the experiment was a success."
211,Nominal clauses: as subjects ,"A nominal clause is a type of dependent clause that acts like a noun in a sentence. Because nouns can function as subjects and objects, nominal clauses can also take these roles.

- Nominal clauses as subjects
Sometimes the subject of a sentence is not a single word, but a whole clause. These clauses often begin with that, what, whether, or how.

Example: That she passed the exam surprised everyone.
Here, the entire clause That she passed the exam is the subject of the verb surprised.

- Nominal clauses as objects
Nominal clauses are very common as the object of a verb, especially after verbs like know, think, believe, wonder, decide, explain, etc.

Example: I don’t know what he wants.
Here, the clause what he wants is the object of the verb know.

They can also be the object of a preposition:
Example: We talked about what happened yesterday.","1. What she decided to do next surprised everyone in the team.
2. That the company is expanding so quickly is impressive.
3. Whether we can meet the deadline depends on everyone's cooperation.
4. How he managed to solve the problem remains a mystery."

Sometimes the subject of a sentence is not a single word, but a whole clause. These clauses often begin with that, what, whether, or how.

Example: I don’t know what he wants.
Here, the clause what he wants is the object of the verb know.

They can also be the object of a preposition:
Example: We talked about what happened yesterday.","1. I don’t understand why she left the meeting early.
2.  She couldn’t explain what had caused the sudden drop in sales.
3. He admitted that he had made a mistake in the report.
4. The teacher asked me whether I had completed the assignment on time."
213,"Punctuation for complex sentences: colons, semi-colons","- Learners are expected to write more complex sentences that express detailed ideas. Two useful punctuation marks for linking and organizing these ideas are the colon (:) and the semi-colon (;).

- The Colon (:): A colon is used to introduce or explain something. It tells the reader that more information is coming.
You can use it before a list, an explanation, definition, or a summary.
The part before the colon should be a complete sentence.

Example:She has three main hobbies: reading, painting, and cooking.

- The Semi-Colon (;)A semi-colon is used to connect two ideas that are closely related.
It can join two independent sentences without using a conjunction (like and, but). It can also be used in lists when the items are long or already contain commas.

Example:I have a meeting tomorrow; however, I still plan to join the dinner later.","1. I need to buy several things for the trip: a raincoat, a flashlight, and a pair of hiking boots.
2. The teacher gave us only one piece of advice: never stop asking questions.
3. Some students prefer science subjects; others enjoy literature and history more."
214,Formal and informal registers in grammar,"- We use different registers depending on the situation, audience, and purpose. The two most common registers are formal and informal.

- Formal register is used in professional, academic, or official situations. It often avoids contractions, uses complete sentences, and prefers more precise vocabulary. For example, instead of saying “kids”, we say “children”. Instead of “I’m gonna”, we say “I am going to”. Formal grammar avoids slang and phrasal verbs when possible, choosing single-word verbs such as “purchase” instead of “buy”.

- Informal register, on the other hand, is used in casual conversations with friends, family, or people we know well. It often includes contractions (can’t, don’t), slang, phrasal verbs, and shorter sentences. It may also include more personal pronouns and relaxed grammar structures, such as starting sentences with “And” or “But”.

","1. Formal: I am writing to request further information regarding the upcoming conference.
Informal: Can you send me more info about the conference?
2. Formal: She is unable to attend the meeting due to prior commitments.
Informal: She can’t come to the meeting because she’s busy.
3. Formal: We would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused.
Informal: Sorry if we caused you any trouble."
215,"Hypothetical meaning after 'as if', 'as though'","We use as if and as though to compare a real situation with an unreal or imaginary one. This structure is important for expressing impressions, guesses, or judgments that are not literally true.

- Structure: as if / as though + clause
The verb form in the clause shows whether the situation is real or imaginary.

- Present unreal situations: We use the past tense to describe something that is not real in the present.
Example: He talks as if he knew everything. (He does not actually know everything.)

- Past unreal situations: We use the past perfect to describe something that did not really happen in the past.
Example: She looked as though she had seen a ghost. (She didn’t really see one, but she looked frightened.)

- Realistic impressions: Sometimes, we use the present tense after as if / as though when the situation is probably true.
Example: It looks as if it is going to rain. (This is a real possibility, not imaginary.)","1. He speaks as if he were the boss, but he’s just an intern.
2. She acts as though she had never met me before, even though we studied together.
3. It looks as if they are planning a surprise for you."
216,"Verb + object + infinitive/gerund patterns: allow someone to do, advise someone against doing","- Some verbs are followed by an object (a person or thing) and then either an infinitive (to + verb) or a gerund (-ing form). The choice depends on the main verb.

- Verb + Object + Infinitive: Some verbs require the structure verb + object + to + base verb. This pattern shows that the subject causes, allows, or wants someone else to do something.
Common verbs: allow, advise, encourage, remind, persuade, teach, tell, want, warn
Example: The teacher allowed the students to leave early.

- Verb + Object + Gerund: Some verbs require the structure verb + object + gerund (-ing form). This pattern is often used to give advice, warn against actions, or prevent someone from doing something.
Common verbs: advise against, discourage, prevent, stop, forbid
Example: The doctor advised him against eating too much sugar.","1. The manager allowed the team to take a longer lunch break.
2. She advised him against driving in the heavy rain.
3. They persuaded their friend to join the charity event."
217,Complex question tags: for imperatives,"Question tags are short questions added at the end of a sentence to confirm information, check agreement, or encourage a response.Learners are expected to handle complex question tags—especially those used with imperatives (commands) and suggestions.

- Imperatives + question tags: When using imperatives (commands or instructions), question tags are often used to make the request softer, more polite, or to seek agreement.
The most common tag is “will you?” after a positive imperative.
For negative imperatives (commands with don’t), the usual tag is “will you?” or “won’t you?”, depending on the tone.
“Can you?” and “could you?” are also used to make the request sound friendlier.

Example: Close the door, will you? (a polite request, not a strict order).

- Suggestions + question tags: When making a suggestion with let’s, the typical question tag is “shall we?”. This tag checks agreement or invites confirmation from others.

Example: Let’s go for a walk, shall we?","1. Open the window, will you?
2. Don’t be late, won’t you?
3. Pass me the report, can you?"
218,Complex question tags: for suggestions,"Question tags are short questions added at the end of a sentence to confirm information, check agreement, or encourage a response.Learners are expected to handle complex question tags—especially those used with imperatives (commands) and suggestions.

- Imperatives + question tags: When using imperatives (commands or instructions), question tags are often used to make the request softer, more polite, or to seek agreement.
The most common tag is “will you?” after a positive imperative.
For negative imperatives (commands with don’t), the usual tag is “will you?” or “won’t you?”, depending on the tone.
“Can you?” and “could you?” are also used to make the request sound friendlier.

Example: Close the door, will you? (a polite request, not a strict order).

- Suggestions + question tags: When making a suggestion with let’s, the typical question tag is “shall we?”. This tag checks agreement or invites confirmation from others.

Example: Let’s go for a walk, shall we?","1. We could start the meeting earlier, couldn’t we?
2. I should call her before we leave, shouldn’t I?
3. You’d better double-check the report, hadn’t you?"
219,"Conjunctions expressing concession: while, whereas, even though","Conjunctions of concession are used to show contrast between two ideas in the same sentence. They highlight differences, unexpected results, or opposing information.

- While: can express contrast, not only time. When used this way, it introduces an idea that is different from or opposite to another idea in the sentence.
It often appears at the beginning of a sentence or between two clauses.

Example: While the film was exciting, the ending was disappointing.

- Whereas: is formal and is mainly used in written English.
It clearly introduces a contrast between two facts or situations.It is often used in academic writing, reports, or formal discussions.

Example: Whereas city life is fast and stressful, country life is calm and peaceful.

- Even though- is stronger than although or though. it introduces a fact that makes the main idea surprising or unexpected.It can appear at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence.

Example: Even though he studied hard, he didn’t pass the exam.","1. While many people prefer online shopping, others still enjoy going to physical stores.
2. Whereas my brother loves spicy food, I can’t tolerate it at all.
3. The hotel was expensive, even though the service was not very good."
220,have' as an auxiliary vs. main verb,"- The verb have can be used in English in two main ways: as an auxiliary verb (helping verb) and as a main verb (lexical verb).
- Have as an Auxiliary Verb
When have is used as an auxiliary verb, it helps form the perfect tenses (present perfect, past perfect, future perfect).

- Structure: have/has/had + past participle
It does not carry the main meaning of the sentence but shows time and aspect.
Example: She has finished her homework. (The action is completed, and the focus is on the result.)

- In questions and negatives, have also functions as an auxiliary:
Have you seen this film?
I haven’t spoken to him yet.

- Have as a Main Verb
As a main verb, have usually means to own, to possess, or to experience.
Example: They have a new car. (possession)
Example: We had a great time at the party. (experience)

- When have is a main verb, questions and negatives are often formed using do/does/did (not by inverting have):
Do you have a pen? (NOT: Have you a pen? in modern English, except in very formal British usage)
She doesn’t have enough money","1. We had finished dinner before they arrived. (auxiliary)
2. They have a dog and a cat at home. (main verb – possession)
3. I usually have coffee in the morning. (main verb – routine activity)"
221,"Focusing adverbs: even, only, just","Focusing adverbs are used to highlight or give special attention to a part of the sentence. They help the speaker show importance, restriction, or surprise.
- Even: emphasizes something surprising, unexpected, or extreme.It can be used before the part of the sentence we want to stress (subject, object, verb, or clause).

Example: Even he didn’t know the answer. (It’s surprising because we expected him to know.)

- Only: shows limitation or restriction.It highlights one person, thing, or action and excludes others.Its meaning changes depending on where it is placed in the sentence.

Example: I only spoke to her yesterday. (I didn’t meet, write, or call—just spoke.)

- Just: has several uses, but as a focusing adverb, it means “exactly,” “only,” or “simply.”It often makes the sentence softer or less strong.

Example: It’s just a suggestion. (Nothing more than a suggestion.)","1. Even the teacher found the exam difficult.
2. She only goes to the gym on weekends.
3. We even managed to finish the project ahead of schedule."
222,"Intensifying adverbs: utterly, deeply, ridiculously","Intensifying adverbs are words we use to make adjectives or other adverbs stronger. Some intensifiers are fixed with particular adjectives and sound natural only in those combinations.
- Utterly: means “completely” or “totally,” often used with adjectives that describe extreme states or feelings. It is usually followed by negative or absolute adjectives (e.g., “utterly useless,” “utterly alone”). It emphasizes that there is no middle ground.

- Deeply: means “strongly” or “seriously,” and it expresses powerful emotions or states of mind. It often collocates with feelings such as deeply regret, deeply concerned, deeply grateful. It shows intensity at an emotional or thoughtful level.

- Ridiculously: means “to an absurd or extreme degree.”It is often used to exaggerate or criticize by showing that something is beyond normal limits.
Common collocations include ridiculously expensive, ridiculously easy, ridiculously small.","1. The plan turned out to be utterly impossible to complete within the deadline.
2. She felt deeply moved by the kindness of her students.
3. That restaurant is ridiculously expensive for the quality of food they serve."
223,Clauses of purpose with 'so as to' and 'in order to',"- Learners are expected to use a range of structures to show purpose clearly and formally. Two useful expressions are so as to and in order to. Both are followed by the base form of a verb (the infinitive without to after them). They are used to explain why someone does something, usually in more formal English.

- Meaning and Use
so as to and in order to introduce a clause that explains the purpose of an action.They answer the question “Why?”.
Example: She left early so as to avoid traffic. (Why did she leave early? To avoid traffic.)

- in order to is considered slightly more formal and is common in academic, professional, or written English. so as to is also formal but is often used in spoken and written English where precision is needed. In informal English, we often just use to for purpose: She left early to avoid traffic.","1. He slowed down so as to give the children time to cross the road.
2. She is taking an online course in order to improve her computer skills.
3. They spoke quietly so as not to disturb the other people in the room."
224,Understanding and using idiomatic verb phrases,"- Idiomatic verb phrases are expressions made up of verbs combined with other words (such as prepositions or adverbs) that have a meaning different from the literal meanings of the individual words. Learners are expected not only to recognize common idiomatic verb phrases but also to use them naturally in both spoken and written communication.

- For example, the phrase “give up” does not mean “to physically hand something upwards,” but rather “to stop trying.” Because idiomatic verb phrases are often metaphorical, they cannot be understood simply by translating word by word. This makes them challenging, but also essential for achieving fluency and sounding natural in English.","1. After several attempts, she finally gave up trying to fix the old computer.
2. We are really looking forward to our trip to the mountains next month.
3. The meeting was so boring that he dozed off halfway through the presentation."
225,"Noun + preposition collocations: a reason for, a solution to","Collocations are natural combinations of words that native speakers often use together. These combinations help your English sound more accurate and fluent.

- A reason for: We use this phrase to explain the cause of something. It tells us why something happens.
Example: The heavy rain was a reason for the delay.
Here, ""a reason for"" introduces the cause of the delay.

- A solution to: We use this phrase to introduce an answer to a problem or question.
Example: Technology can offer a solution to many environmental problems.
Here, ""a solution to"" introduces the answer to the problem.","1. The teacher gave us a clear reason for changing the exam date.
2. Is there a reason for your sudden interest in history?
3. The government is still searching for a solution to the pollution crisis."
226,"Double object verbs: give, send, offer","Some verbs can take two objects: a direct object (the thing) and an indirect object (the person who receives the thing). These are called double object verbs. Common examples include give, send, and offer.
- Structure: There are two main patterns:

Verb + indirect object + direct object
She gave me a book.
(me = indirect object / a book = direct object)

Verb + direct object + to/for + indirect object
She gave a book to me.

- Give: usually transfers something physical or abstract.
He gave his friend advice.

- Send: involves movement from one place to another, often with communication.
They sent their teacher an email.

- Offer: suggests presenting something for someone to accept or refuse.
The company offered her a job.","1.My friend gave me her notes after the lecture.
2. The teacher gave the students extra time for the test.
3. He offered his neighbor some help with the heavy bags."
227,Prepositional verbs vs. Phrasal verbs,"- Both prepositional verbs and phrasal verbs combine a verb with a short word (a preposition or a particle). At first they may look similar, but their grammar and meaning are different.

- Prepositional Verbs: A prepositional verb is a verb followed directly by a preposition, and the preposition always has an object. The meaning usually stays close to the original verb. You cannot separate the verb and the preposition.

Example: She looks after her younger brother.
Here, “after” is a preposition and “her younger brother” is its object.

- Phrasal Verbs: A phrasal verb is made of a verb + a particle (often an adverb like up, out, off). The meaning often changes and is more idiomatic, sometimes very different from the original verb. The particle does not function as a preposition.

Example: He gave up smoking.
Here, “up” changes the meaning of “give” completely.","1. She is looking after her grandmother while her parents are away. (prepositional verb)
2. I need to apply for a new passport soon. (prepositional verb)
3. He finally gave up trying to fix the old car. (phrasal verb)"
228,"Hedging and cautious language: It would seem that..., It may be the case that…","- Learners start to use hedging and cautious language to make their ideas sound more polite, less direct, or less certain. Hedging means softening a statement instead of saying something too strongly. This is useful in academic writing, discussions, and professional communication.

For example, instead of saying “This is true”, a speaker might say “It would seem that this is true” or “It may be the case that this is true”. These expressions show that the speaker is open to other possibilities and is not claiming absolute certainty.

- Hedging is important because:
It makes your speech or writing sound more diplomatic.
It shows awareness that other opinions or evidence might exist.
It helps avoid sounding rude, arrogant, or too direct.

-  Some common phrases for hedging are:
It would seem that…; It may be the case that…; It appears that…; It is possible that…; There seems to be…","1. It would seem that students perform better when they study in groups.
2. It may be the case that the results were influenced by outside factors.
3. It appears that fewer people are reading newspapers nowadays."
229,"-ing and -ed clauses (the woman talking to Tom, the boy injured in the accident)","- We often use -ing clauses and -ed clauses to make our sentences shorter and more natural. These clauses are a type of reduced relative clause. Instead of using a full relative clause with who/which/that, we can use an -ing form (present participle) or an -ed form (past participle).

- -ing Clauses: describes an active action (something the person or thing is doing). It usually replaces a relative clause with the verb in the continuous form.

Full clause: The woman who is talking to Tom is my teacher.
Reduced clause: The woman talking to Tom is my teacher.

- Here, “talking to Tom” describes the woman.

- -ed Clauses: describes a passive action (something done to the person or thing). It usually replaces a relative clause with the passive form.

Full clause: The boy who was injured in the accident went to the hospital.
Reduced clause: The boy injured in the accident went to the hospital.

- Here, “injured in the accident” describes the boy.","1. The students studying in the library are preparing for exams.
2. A letter sent by my friend arrived yesterday.
3. The man waiting at the bus stop looks very tired."
230,in case,"- The expression “in case” is used to show that something is done as a precaution or preparation for a possible future situation. It does not mean “if,” but rather “because something might happen.”
- Form:In case + subject + verb

Often followed by the present simple, though other tenses are possible depending on context.We use it to explain the reason for an action when we are preparing for something that might happen. It focuses on prevention or readiness, not on conditional results.","1. I always carry some cash in case the card machine doesn’t work.
2. She left early in case there was heavy traffic on the way.
3. Take my phone number in case you get lost."
231,by and until  by the time ...,"- Expressions like by, until, and by the time help us show deadlines (the latest point something happens) or duration (how long something continues).
- By: means “not later than”.
It shows the latest possible time something can happen, but it may happen earlier. Common with deadlines, appointments, and promises.It often goes with perfect tenses.

Example: I’ll finish this report by Friday. (maybe earlier, but no later than Friday)

- Until: shows how long something continues, from a starting point to an ending point in time. It focuses on the duration, not the deadline.It usually goes with continuous or simple tenses.

Example: She stayed at the party until midnight. (the action continued up to midnight)

- By the time: introduces a point in time when something else happens.It shows that one action is already finished before another begins.Common with past perfect or future perfect.

Example: By the time we arrived, the film had already started.","1. I need to submit the application by tomorrow evening.
2. He will wait here until the manager comes back.
3. By the time I reached the station, the train had already left."
232,"Noun + preposition (reason for, cause of etc.)","- Many nouns are followed by specific prepositions to create fixed expressions. These combinations are important because they help express clear relationships between ideas, such as reason, cause, effect, responsibility, or connection. 
For example:reason for; cause of; effect on; increase in; solution to; responsibility for

- These combinations cannot usually be changed without making the sentence incorrect. For instance, we say “the reason for his absence” but not “the reason of his absence.”","1. The reason for the delay was heavy traffic in the city.
2. Climate change is a major cause of extreme weather events.
3. There has been a sharp increase in online shopping over the past few years."
233,Verb + preposition (about/for/of/after) (about and of) ,"- Some verbs are often followed by specific prepositions. This combination gives the verb a particular meaning. Knowing which preposition to use is essential because the meaning can change or sound incorrect if the wrong one is chosen.
- Verb + about: When a verb is followed by about, it usually refers to the subject or topic of a conversation, thought, or feeling.
Talk about → to discuss a topic.
Think about → to consider or reflect on something.
Complain about → to express dissatisfaction regarding something.
Ask about → to request information on a subject.
- These verbs show focus on the topic or subject matter.

- Verb + of: When a verb is followed by of, it often expresses recognition, memory, or judgment.
Approve of → to have a positive opinion.
Disapprove of → to have a negative opinion.
Remind (someone) of → to cause someone to remember.
Consist of → to be made up of.
Accuse (someone) of → to say that someone is guilty of something.
- These verbs are more about evaluation, composition, or recalling.","1. She often complains about the noise from the street outside her apartment.
2. The committee did not approve of his careless behavior during the meeting.
3. He reminded me of the rules we agreed on before starting the project."
234,Phrasal verbs out/away/back ,"- Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a particle (such as out, away, or back) that create a new meaning different from the verb alone. 
- Phrasal Verbs with Out
These often suggest leaving, finishing, or becoming visible.
Run out (of something) = to finish a supply.
Find out = to discover information.
Work out = to solve or to exercise.

- Phrasal Verbs with Away
These often suggest movement, disappearance, or continuation.
Give away = to donate or reveal.
Throw away = to discard.
Run away = to escape.

- Phrasal Verbs with Back
These usually suggest returning to a place, state, or condition.
Go back = to return.
Call back = to return a phone call.
Take back = to withdraw words or to return an item.","1. We ran out of sugar, so we need to buy some more.
2. She was surprised when she found out the truth about her friend.
3. Don’t throw away those papers; we might need them later."
